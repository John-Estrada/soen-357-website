          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p >Our research began by examining market websites and apps of several different styles, although unfortunately there were not any examples of a user data market that we were able to find. We compared several of the most common to get an idea of the different styles so that we could better develop our interview questions and begin considering how to adapt one of these styles to work as a user data market.</p>

          <h3>What works and doesn't work in current markets</h3>
          <hr>

          <h5>eBay</h4>
          <p >eBay is known for its auction system, in which sellers post an item for sale with a starting price and buyers can either bid on the item, or buy it instantly for a higher price. This is a seller focused market that we believe may be difficult to adapt to selling user data, as it is designed to handle one seller per buyer, instead of mass purchases made by a large company. Transactions are handled automatically by PayPal, which can benefit both buyers and sellers for convenience.</p>

          <h5>Kijiji</h4>
          <p >Kijiji is the local marketplace (similar to craigslist) that is most common in Montreal. This style of market is better suited to selling physical items to people who live nearby and are likely to pay in cash. For this reason, there is no automatic payment system and sales are informal between the buyer and seller, with the seller simply deleting a post once a sale has been made. One advantage for users is that the market is more anonymous and does not expose their payment information or address to other users (either buyers or sellers), allowing them to remain anonymous if they wish. The main disadvantage is that, like eBay, it is not well suited to mass purchases or sales.</p>

          <h5>Stock Market Apps</h4>
          <p >Many stock market trading websites and apps exist, although most of them follow the same general format. Prices are automatically set by a collective of buy and sell orders. This style of market is well suited to mass sales and purchases, although differentiating a product (like individual pieces of user data) is difficult. Payments are usually done through a bank transfer, with the user’s account holding a certain amount of funds or stocks as they buy and sell.</p>

          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <hr>
          <p >After examining existing market websites and apps, we decided to create a set of questions to interview a small sample of people who could potentially be users of a data market. We decided to keep the interview short so that the subjects would think more about the individual questions. Our questions focused on which style of market the users would expect, how they would interact with the market, and their trust in a rating system and security.</p>

          <h5>Questions</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>What style of marketplace would you expect a data market to look most like? (e.g. ebay style auction, kijiji style sell offers, stock market style with constantly changing prices, or something else?)</li>
            <li>Would you like to sell the entirety of your data as one package, or individual pieces of information to different buyers?</li>
            <li>Would you like or trust a buyer rating system, or do you believe that it is too prone to manipulation?</li>
            <li>What sort of security measures would you expect from a data marketplace?</li>
          </ol>
          <p></p>
          <h5>Answers</h5>
          <p>Most of our subjects answered that they expected a sales system similar to eBay, with users able to post an offer that the buyer will bid on. The answers on whether they would like to sell all of their data together or in a package were mixed and sometimes vague. Most of the subjects stated that they would not trust a rating system for buyers, as it would be too prone to manipulation. Finally all of the subjects stated that they would like to see good security, but the only specific suggestion was 2-factor authentication.</p>

          <h2>Design</h2>
          <p>After completing the research phase, we moved on to the design. In this section, we created several user personas to give us an idea of who would be using our app. We also created a user journey to better map out how a person would use the app, as well as an empathy map to understand the reasons a person might choose our app over a competitor's</p>

          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>We created three user personas that we feel represented different user demographics: one young person who is familiar with technology in their personal life, an older retired person who is not familiar with technology, and a middle aged person who interacts with technology in their career.</p>

                    <li class="list-group-item">About:<br>Lives with her fiancé of 3 years. Ever since she recovered from an identity fraud a few years ago, she has been worried about the data she is giving online. After realising that most websites ask for personal information (such as name, locations, etc..), she always wondered if anything can be done to make sure her information is well secured.
                      Arya also often buys online from websites such as Ebay. However, after years of purchase, she believes that many of the user ratings are getting manipulated to give the seller a better advantage against competitors. This gives her a sense that datas is easily manipulated anywhere and that a better approach is needed to give a better, more accurate and secure data exchange.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Goal:<br>To feel more secure about her data, she’d like to know exactly how her data would be used, how many times and by who.

          <h3>User Journey</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>We decided to evaluate our proposed interface by using a User Journey, mapping out the hypothetical process that a user will take from signing up for our data marketplace.</p>
          <p>Scope - the user’s reasons for using our app and their interactions with the UI we have designed as they sell their data.</p>
          <p>Persona - this user journey will focus on the persona Arya Stark, a 24 year old immigration consultant that has been a victim of identity theft. She is therefore interested in keeping her data secured and benefiting from it instead of allowing another company to profit from using information about her.</p>
          <p>Scenario and User Expectations - this user expects to have control over their data, and be able to view who has bought and used it. They also expect to have security features at their disposal, such as 2-factor authentication. Finally, they expect to profit from the use of their own data.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>Another technique used to design interfaces is the Empathy Map, which takes into consideration the thoughts, feelings, and actions of a user. We decided to use our second persona, a retired man, to create an empathy map to better understand how this demographic might use our app.</p>
